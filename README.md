# Idriç x86-64 backend

This branch is the executable x86-64 compiler route:

\`\`\`text
checked .idric source
  → compiler-owned one-step-at-a-time form
  → scalar backend plan
  → directly encoded x86-64
  → directly emitted ELF64
  → native Linux execution
\`\`\`

The canonical \`PrintX.idric\` fixture writes exactly \`X\` and exits 0. Seven
additional fixtures exercise add, subtract, multiply, both conditional-branch
outcomes, a direct internal call, and six-argument register pressure. The
production route uses no RefC, generated C, C compiler, assembler, linker,
libc, CRT, or target-Chez fallback.

The active compiler dependency is the declared \`isomorphisms/Idric\` branch
recorded in [\`IDRIC_COMPILER_REF\`](IDRIC_COMPILER_REF), currently \`Idriç\`.
CI resolves that branch for every run and records the exact compiler SHA that
actually ran. Incompatibility with the current compiler fails the lane; it does
not retry the first known-green revision.

The first complete green tuple remains historical evidence: Idric PR #63 at
\`dd313277fedb2b678ff0df6769ed1330a2e80523\` with backend
\`e11a69d4d00501531ee058fa3d880267d5fc6d2e\`.

## Run the complete route

\`\`\`sh
git clone https://github.com/isomorphisms/Idric.git .idric
git -C .idric checkout Idriç
.idric/_/edric bootstrap
make ci
\`\`\`

\`make ci\` runs 44 tests with no skips, compiles all eight real \`.idric\`
fixtures, regenerates every artifact and executable byte-for-byte, validates
ELF64 with \`file\` and \`readelf\`, disassembles the emitted bytes with \`objdump\`,
runs each executable natively, and compares exact stdout and exit status.
Evidence is retained under \`build/checked-x86/<fixture>/\`.

## Compact scalar target primitives

[\`backend/small_scalars.py\`](backend/small_scalars.py) adds direct x86-64 scalar
target support for the five compact-format specification families documented by
the ARM Thumb work: Float16, OCP FP8 (E4M3 and E5M2), OCP E3M2,
Ootomo-Naruse E5M3, and Idris 2 Bits8. Float16/OFP8/E3M2 widen one value at a
time to scalar Float32 SSE arithmetic and round back immediately; E5M3 remains
storage-only; Bits8 uses scalar general-purpose-register operations.

This is target primitive evidence, not a claim that the current compiler-owned
one-step handoff already exposes those operations from ordinary \`.idric\`
source. See [\`docs/small-scalar-formats.md\`](docs/small-scalar-formats.md) for
the exact format and evidence boundary.

Top-level symbolic links expose the same implementation and acceptance files
without moving the preserved PR work.
