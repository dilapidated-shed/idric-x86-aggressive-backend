# Checked Idriç to direct x86-64 baseline

## Canonical line

The baseline branch is `backend/checked-idric-direct-elf64`, based on current
`main` (`f834a160d4256147d7498c01a3da1df36b7b5687`). Ordinary integration follows
the current declared `isomorphisms/Idric` ref `Idriç` and records the SHA resolved for each
run. The first known-green historical handoff was Idric PR #63, revision
`dd313277fedb2b678ff0df6769ed1330a2e80523`; that SHA is evidence, not the
active dependency selector.

The compiler revision parses and elaborates ordinary `.idric` source, completes
core checking, and invokes its built-in `idric-one-step` code generator. That
generator calls the compiler's own ANF compilation pass and serializes the
result as `EDRIC_ONE_STEP_BODY v1`. The wrapper binds it to source SHA-256,
the full compiler revision, `core_typecheck PASS`, a representation version,
and a body SHA-256. No source recognizer or handwritten rows participate in
this scalar route.

The backend accepts only this artifact. It never parses `.idric` text; its
optional source argument verifies only the recorded source digest. Unknown
definitions, operations, calls, closures, applications, or artifact rows fail
closed.

## Real fixtures

| Source | Compiler work exercised | Exact stdout | Exit |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `PrintX.idric` | character constant and `putChar` | `58` (`X`) | 0 |
| `Add.idric` | `12 + 7` | `13` | 0 |
| `Subtract.idric` | `12 - 7` | `05` | 0 |
| `Multiply.idric` | `12 * 7` | `54` | 0 |
| `BranchTrue.idric` | `7 < 12`, true arm | `29` | 0 |
| `BranchFalse.idric` | `12 < 7`, false arm | `63` | 0 |
| `DirectCall.idric` | direct call `increment 40` | `29` | 0 |
| `RegisterPressure.idric` | six-argument `sum_six` | `15` | 0 |

Arithmetic fixtures deliberately write the resulting byte, so the table uses
hexadecimal stdout. The expected results live in the acceptance test, not in
the emitter. Inspection shows arithmetic, comparison, branches, and calls in
the executable; the backend's exact range proof is validation and never folds
the proved result into an output constant.

## Supported one-step-at-a-time surface

- signed-i64 integer and one-byte character constants;
- variables and nested compiler lets;
- value movement with deterministic actual stack spill slots where used;
- `+Int`, `-Int`, `*Int` and bounded `Integer` counterparts;
- `<`, `<=`, and `==` for the same bounded scalar representation;
- compiler constant cases, conditional branches, and unconditional joins;
- direct internal calls of up to six scalar arguments;
- return in `rax`;
- representation-preserving casts proven safe for this bounded route;
- `Prelude.IO.prim__putChar` as direct Linux `write`, followed by process exit.

Compiler names do not imply memory stores. The current correctness-first
scheme assigns explicit stack homes when it actually spills, uses `rax` and
`r11` for arithmetic reuse, passes direct-call arguments in six deterministic
registers, eliminates the world token and safe casts, and records each decision
in the backend plan. The pressure fixture proves the scheme does not silently
miscompile when every argument register is occupied.

The exact range proof currently requires the closed scalar execution to prove
all reachable values fit signed i64 and the output fits one byte. This makes
arbitrary-precision `Integer`, external input, wide-character UTF-8 output,
and overflow fail as unsupported instead of inheriting accidental x86 wrapping.

## Concrete x86-64 surface

The scalar fixtures emit only baseline x86-64 encodings:

- REX.W prefixes;
- `mov` register/immediate, register/register, stack load, and stack store;
- `add`, `sub`, and two-operand `imul`;
- `cmp`, `setl`, `setle`, `sete`, and `movzx`;
- `lea` for the output-byte address;
- rel32 `call`, `jmp`, and `je` with deterministic fixups;
- `ret`, `xor`, `syscall`, and an unreachable-default `ud2` guard;
- `sub/add rsp, imm32` for deterministic aligned frames.

No AVX, AVX2, AVX-512, BMI, AMX, string-instruction optimization, CPU dispatch,
or vendor-specific extension is required. The XED inventory remains reference
material rather than an implementation checklist.

## Process, call, and ELF ownership

The ELF entry is the compiler-owned process entry at virtual address
`0x401000`. Linux supplies the initial stack; the program reads no startup
arguments or environment. Entry frames are multiples of 16 bytes. Internal
callees account for the pushed return address so nested call sites retain
16-byte stack alignment.

The internal convention uses `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, and `r9` for up
to six scalar arguments and `rax` for the result. It is an Idriç backend
convention, not a promise that all Idriç values have a C ABI representation.
Output uses Linux x86-64 syscall 1 (`write`) and termination uses syscall 60
(`exit`). There is no CRT or libc.

`backend/elf64.py` writes the complete image in-process: ELF identification,
`ET_EXEC`, machine 62, entry, one read/execute `PT_LOAD`, deterministic file and
memory sizes, 4096-byte alignment, and code placement. The image has no
sections, interpreter, dynamic segment, relocations, or external construction
step. `file`, `readelf`, and `objdump` are independent validators only.

## Reconciliation of the old stack

- PR #3 remains the large XED inventory/research reference. The baseline does
  not depend on its generated inventory; only its conclusion to implement a
  tiny evidence-driven subset is retained.
- PR #11 proved direct x86 bytes, minimal ELF64 ownership, Linux `write`/`exit`,
  and exact `X` execution from a backend plan. Its useful ELF and encoding
  ideas are consolidated here; its source regex recognizer is not.
- PR #17's deterministic labels/fixups and scalar search/control-flow code are
  preserved in `backend/x86_control.py` with its tests. The string-search
  fixture is still a lower-level backend regression because the current small
  compiler form does not yet expose strings or indexed byte loads.
- PR #18's R128 artifact validator, scalar plan, direct encoding, ELF execution,
  and receipts are preserved in `backend/r128_math.py`. The accompanying
  checked R128 emitter runs in CI as an additional regression. Its source
  manually prints domain-specific artifact rows, so it is not the definition
  of the new compiler-owned scalar handoff.
- Current `main` contributes the already-merged biology contrast workflow and
  is the base of this branch. It was absent from every old stacked branch.

The old branches share only the original repository commit with current main
and diverge from each other above PR #11. A clean consolidation on current
main was therefore safer than rebasing the large inventory and divergent R128
and search histories. Working code was preserved; the speculative ISA
inventory was not merged into the executable line.

## Explicitly unsupported

Unsupported today: general heap values, closures, partial application,
recursion, calls with more than six scalar arguments, arbitrary-precision
runtime integers, floating point, strings, arrays, allocation, external input,
UTF-8 output beyond one byte, foreign/C interoperability, dynamic linking,
non-Linux targets, and non-x86-64 targets.

Search and biology remain preserved lower-level regressions rather than claimed
checked compiler fixtures. R128 remains an additional domain-specific
regression. No language-design question about tensors, rotations, refinement
types, dimensions, or Float16 blocked this scalar baseline, and none was
decided by it.
